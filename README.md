# Exploratory Data Analysis on Air Quality Dataset

## Dataset Overview

This project involves performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Air Quality dataset**. The dataset contains information related to air quality measurements and various attributes that help in understanding pollution levels, air quality trends, and anomalies. The data was sourced from [insert data source here if applicable, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, etc.].

### Dataset Details:
- **Number of Rows**: 200+
- **Number of Columns**: 6+
- **Key Attributes**: Air quality measurements, pollutants, time stamps, etc.

## Project Objective

The objective of this analysis is to:
- Gain a deep understanding of the structure and distribution of the air quality data.
- Detect any issues related to data quality (e.g., missing values, duplicates, outliers).
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and encoding for further modeling if required.
- Identify trends and insights that could inform air quality monitoring and policies.

## Data Analysis Process

### 1. **Dataset Overview**
We first loaded the dataset and performed an initial check on its structure:
- Displayed the first and last few rows of the dataset.
- Checked the dataset’s shape (rows × columns), column names, and data types of each feature.
- Analyzed missing values and unique values per column.

### 2. **Data Quality Checks**
- **Missing Values**: We identified missing values in some columns and handled them using imputation (mean/median) or by dropping rows/columns with significant missing data.
- **Duplicate Rows**: Duplicate records were removed to avoid bias in analysis.
- **Erroneous Data**: Negative or invalid values (e.g., negative air quality readings) were corrected.
- **Formatting Issues**: We standardized categorical data (e.g., inconsistent case formatting, leading/trailing spaces).

### 3. **Data Cleaning**
We applied several cleaning techniques:
- **Imputed missing data** with median values for continuous columns.
- **Removed duplicate rows** to ensure data integrity.
- **Corrected invalid values**, ensuring all air quality readings were non-negative.
- **Standardized formatting** across categorical features.

### 4. **Descriptive Statistics**
We calculated key statistical measures to better understand the dataset:
- **Central Tendencies**: Mean, Median, Mode.
- **Spread**: Minimum, Maximum, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- **Skewness and Kurtosis** were also computed to understand the distribution of numerical features.

### 5. **Data Transformation & Encoding**
We performed data transformation and encoding steps:
- **Scaling/Normalization**: Applied Standard Scaling to ensure numerical features were on a comparable scale.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Used One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables to prepare the dataset for any machine learning models.

### 6. **Outlier Detection & Treatment**
We applied two methods to detect outliers:
- **IQR Method**: We detected and treated outliers by capping or removing them.
- **Z-Score**: Outliers with Z-scores greater than 3 or less than -3 were flagged for further treatment.

### 7. **Data Visualization**
To gain deeper insights into the data, we performed various visualizations:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms, Box Plots, and Bar Charts were used to analyze the distribution of individual variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Scatter Plots, Pair Plots, and Correlation Heatmaps were employed to identify relationships between key features.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: A PCA was performed to reduce dimensionality and visualize the most important features.

### 8. **Key Insights**
After analyzing the data, the following key insights were obtained:
- **Air Quality Trends**: We observed certain seasonal variations in air quality, with pollution levels peaking during colder months.
- **Anomalies**: Some unexpected spikes in air quality measurements were detected, possibly due to specific events (e.g., industrial activities).
- **Feature Relationships**: Strong correlations were found between temperature, humidity, and air quality levels, which may inform predictive modeling.

## Next Steps

Based on the findings from this EDA, the next steps could include:
- **Modeling**: Train machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) to predict air quality levels based on various features.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Conduct further analysis on air quality over time to detect trends or forecast future pollution levels.
- **Deploying Solutions**: Use the insights gained from this analysis to inform public health policies or city planning related to air pollution.
